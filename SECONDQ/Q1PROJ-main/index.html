            <img src="images/sdg11.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;" class="sdg11">
            <p><b>Sustainable Development Goal 11</b> aims to transform cities and human settlements into inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable environments. With over half of the world's population now living in urban areas, the need for well-planned, eco-friendly cities has never been more urgent. SDG 11 addresses critical challenges such as air pollution, inadequate infrastructure, and the effects of climate change, with the goal of ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, has access to a high quality of life in a thriving urban environment.</p>
            <p>By promoting smart urban planning, affordable housing, sustainable transportation, and green public spaces, SDG 11 helps cities evolve to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population while minimizing environmental impacts.</p>
